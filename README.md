# Apex-Visualforce-Cumulus
Examples of code in Apex for Visualforce 

This is the trigger that utilizes Non Profit Starter's Pack (AkA Cumulus) trigger framework. It basically creates a record in a child object of opportunity soft_credit__c.
And the test class for it.
I took the trigger framework cause it is more advanced than just simple trigger and it is agreed that using trigger framework is best practice.
